# OAuth 2.0 Implementation Guide

*Last Updated: March 18, 2025*

## Overview

This document outlines the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework implementation standards for our services. OAuth 2.0 enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.

## Authorization Code Flow

The Authorization Code flow is recommended for server-side applications where source code is not publicly exposed:

1. Client initiates flow by directing user to authorization endpoint
2. User authenticates and authorizes the application
3. Authorization server redirects back with authorization code
4. Client exchanges code for access token and refresh token
5. Client uses access token to access protected resources

|  Client |          & Redirection URI                  |
|         |                                             |
|         |<---(E)----- Access Token -------------------'
+---------+       (w/ Optional Refresh Token)
```

## Security Considerations

### Token Storage
- Access tokens must be stored securely
- Never store tokens in localStorage or sessionStorage in browser environments
- Use HTTP-only cookies or secure storage mechanisms

### PKCE Extension
For public clients (mobile apps, SPAs), implement Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE):

1. Client creates a code verifier and code challenge
2. Code challenge is sent in authorization request
3. Code verifier is sent when exchanging authorization code for tokens
4. Authorization server validates code verifier against challenge

### Token Validation
- Always validate tokens before processing requests
- Check signature, expiration, issuer, and audience claims
- Implement proper token revocation mechanisms

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Register client application with authorization server
- [ ] Implement secure token storage
- [ ] Add PKCE for public clients
- [ ] Implement token refresh logic
- [ ] Add token validation middleware
- [ ] Set up proper error handling
- [ ] Implement logout and token revocation
