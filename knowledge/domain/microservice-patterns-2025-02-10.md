# Microservice Architecture Patterns

*Last Updated: February 10, 2025*

## Overview

This document outlines key microservice architecture patterns that have been adopted as standards within our organization. These patterns address common challenges in distributed systems and provide consistent approaches to solving recurring problems.

## Core Patterns

### API Gateway Pattern

The API Gateway serves as a single entry point for all clients, routing requests to appropriate microservices, handling cross-cutting concerns, and providing a unified API to clients.

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Use API Gateway for authentication/authorization
- Implement rate limiting at the gateway level
- Configure timeout policies appropriate to each service
- Implement circuit breakers for resilience

**Current Implementation:**
- Kong API Gateway with custom plugins
- JWT authentication with role-based access control
- Rate limiting based on client ID and endpoint

### Service Discovery Pattern

Service Discovery allows services to find and communicate with each other without hardcoded locations.

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Use a dedicated service registry
- Implement health checks for all services
- Configure appropriate TTL for service registrations
- Implement client-side or server-side discovery based on use case

**Current Implementation:**
- Consul for service registry
- Health checks every 10 seconds
- 30-second TTL for service registrations

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

Circuit Breakers prevent cascading failures by detecting when a service is unavailable and stopping requests to that service.

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Configure appropriate thresholds based on service SLAs
- Implement fallback mechanisms for critical operations
- Configure half-open state retry policies
- Monitor circuit breaker status for operational insights

**Current Implementation:**
- Resilience4j for Java services
- Polly for .NET services
- Default threshold: 50% failure rate over 20 requests
- Default recovery: half-open after 30 seconds, allowing 2 test requests

## Data Management Patterns

### Database per Service

Each service has its own database, ensuring loose coupling and independent scaling.

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Choose database technology appropriate to service needs
- Implement data synchronization where necessary
- Define clear boundaries for data ownership
- Use event sourcing for complex data sharing scenarios

**Current Implementation:**
- PostgreSQL for transactional services
- MongoDB for document-oriented services
- Redis for caching and temporary data
- Event-based synchronization for shared data

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

Separates read and write operations for more scalable and maintainable systems.

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Separate read and write models
- Use eventual consistency where appropriate
- Implement materialized views for complex read operations
- Consider event sourcing for command side

**Current Implementation:**
- Axon Framework for Java services
- Custom implementation for Node.js services
- Event store using Apache Kafka
- Read models in specialized databases optimized for query patterns

## Communication Patterns

### Event-Driven Architecture

Services communicate through events, reducing coupling and enabling reactive systems.

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Define clear event schemas and versioning
- Implement idempotent event handlers
- Use dead letter queues for failed event processing
- Consider event sourcing for critical business processes

**Current Implementation:**
- Apache Kafka as event backbone
- Avro for schema definition and evolution
- Event versioning with compatibility validation
- Dead letter topics with automated alerting

### Saga Pattern

Coordinates transactions spanning multiple services, maintaining data consistency without distributed transactions.

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Define clear compensation actions for each step
- Implement idempotent operations
- Use a saga coordinator for complex flows
- Monitor saga execution for timeouts and failures

**Current Implementation:**
- Choreography-based sagas for simple flows
- Orchestration-based sagas for complex flows
- Kafka Streams for saga coordination
- Timeout handling with compensating actions
