<exploration>
  Considered several approaches for date formatting:
  1. Using existing libraries like moment.js or date-fns
  2. Creating a custom implementation using native Date methods
  3. Using Intl.DateTimeFormat API
  
  Researched bundle size implications of external libraries:
  - moment.js: ~300KB
  - date-fns: ~40KB (tree-shakable)
  - Custom implementation: minimal size
  
  Consulted MDN documentation on Date object methods and formatting best practices.
</exploration>

<trade-off>
  Options considered:
  - External library: More features, larger bundle size
  - Native Date API: Smaller bundle size, more maintenance
  - Intl.DateTimeFormat: Good localization but less control over format strings
  
  Chose custom implementation with native Date API because:
  1. We only need basic date formatting functionality
  2. Bundle size is a priority for this project
  3. Format string approach provides flexibility for different display needs
</trade-off>

<attempt>
  First implementation used string concatenation:
  ```js
  return month + '/' + day + '/' + year;
  ```
  
  This worked but didn't handle format customization. Refactored to use string replacement for flexibility.
  
  Tried using regex for replacements but found simple string replacement more readable.
</attempt>

<edge-case>
  Invalid date inputs would result in "Invalid Date" being displayed.
  
  Added validation check using isNaN(d.getTime()) to throw a clear error message instead.
  
  Also handled both string dates and Date objects as input parameters for flexibility.
</edge-case>

<insight>
  Realized that padding single-digit months and days with leading zeros improves readability and sorting.
  
  Implemented using String.padStart(2, '0') which is more concise than conditional concatenation.
</insight>

<follow-up>
  Need to add support for:
  - Time formatting
  - Localization options
  - Additional format tokens (HH, mm, ss, etc.)
  
  Dependencies: None, but should coordinate with the team working on the date picker component.
