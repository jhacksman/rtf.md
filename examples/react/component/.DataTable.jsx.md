<exploration>
  Explored different approaches for data table implementation:
  1. Using existing libraries (react-table, material-ui)
  2. Building custom component from scratch
  3. Extending an existing simple table with additional features
  
  Researched performance considerations for large datasets:
  - Virtual scrolling vs. pagination
  - Memoization strategies
  - Efficient sorting algorithms
  
  Consulted React documentation on hooks and effect dependencies.
</exploration>

<trade-off>
  Options considered:
  - Third-party library: Feature-rich but adds dependencies
  - Custom implementation: Full control but more development time
  - CSS-only virtualization: Lighter weight but less flexible
  
  Chose custom implementation because:
  1. We need precise control over styling and behavior
  2. Third-party libraries added too much bundle size
  3. The specific feature set needed wasn't available in a lightweight package
</trade-off>

<attempt>
  First implementation used class components:
  ```jsx
  class DataTable extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
        currentPage: 1,
        sortColumn: props.defaultSortColumn,
        sortDirection: 'asc'
      };
    }
    // ...
  }
  ```
  
  This worked but was verbose and harder to maintain. Refactored to functional component with hooks for better readability and maintainability.
</attempt>

<refactor-reason>
  Refactored from class component to functional component with hooks.
  
  Improvements after refactoring:
  - Code is more concise and readable
  - Logic is better separated into distinct concerns
  - Easier to test individual pieces
  - More consistent with modern React patterns
</refactor-reason>

<performance-bottleneck>
  Initial implementation re-sorted the entire dataset on every render.
  
  Analysis showed this was causing jank when sorting large datasets.
  
  Optimization: Moved sorting logic into useEffect with proper dependencies to only re-sort when necessary.
</performance-bottleneck>

<edge-case>
  Empty data arrays would cause rendering errors.
  
  Added conditional rendering to handle empty state gracefully with a "No data available" message.
</edge-case>

<aha-moment>
  Realized that we could make the entire row clickable instead of adding a separate action column.
  
  This simplified the API and improved the user experience by making the entire row a target.
</aha-moment>

<follow-up>
  Follow-up work needed:
  - Add column resizing
  - Implement row selection (checkboxes)
  - Add export functionality
  - Create custom cell renderers
  
  Dependencies: Need design specs for selection behavior before implementing.
