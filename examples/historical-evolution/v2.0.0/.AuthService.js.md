  prompt: "Implement secure token storage and refresh mechanism"

</metadata>

<security>
  Security considerations addressed:
  - Moved from localStorage to SecureStorage for token storage
  - Implemented proper token refresh mechanism
  - Added token validation and expiration handling
  - Server-side logout to invalidate tokens
  - JWT decoding with proper error handling
  
  These changes address the security audit findings related to token storage and management.
</security>

<domain-knowledge>
  Applied OAuth 2.0 best practices for token refresh flows.
  Implemented proper token validation and secure storage.
  [See OAuth 2.0 implementation guide](/knowledge/api/oauth2-spec-2025-03-18.md)
  [See JWT security guidelines](/knowledge/api/jwt-security-2024-09-30.md)
</domain-knowledge>

<refactor-reason>
  Complete refactoring of the authentication service.
  
  Improvements after refactoring:
  - Proper separation of concerns (token storage, validation, refresh)
  - Async/await pattern consistently applied
  - Better error handling with specific error types
  - Prevention of token refresh race conditions
  - Helper method for authenticated API requests
</refactor-reason>

<mental-model>
  Conceptual framework used: Token-based authentication with refresh cycle
  
  Mental model evolution:
  - v1.0.0: Simple token storage and basic authentication
  - v1.1.0: Added expiration validation but still basic storage
  - v2.0.0: Complete security model with secure storage, refresh, and proper validation
  
  This evolution reflects growing understanding of JWT security best practices.
</mental-model>

<debugging>
  Encountered race condition when multiple requests triggered token refresh simultaneously.
  
  Identified by observing multiple refresh requests in network tab during testing.
  
  Solved by implementing a promise-based locking mechanism that ensures only one refresh request is made at a time.
</debugging>

<edge-case>
  Edge cases addressed:
  - Token about to expire (added 30-second buffer)
  - Failed refresh attempts (clear tokens and force re-authentication)
  - Network failures during logout (continue with local logout)
  - Simultaneous refresh requests (promise-based locking)
</edge-case>

<code-review-feedback>
  Feedback received from security team:
  - Suggested using a promise for refresh to prevent race conditions
  - Recommended adding explicit error types
  - Suggested adding fetchWithAuth helper method
  
  All suggestions were implemented in the final version.
</code-review-feedback>

<technical-debt>
  All previous technical debt has been addressed:
  - Secure token storage implemented
  - Token refresh mechanism added
  - Proper validation of tokens
  - Comprehensive error handling
  
  No known technical debt remains in this component.
</technical-debt>

<follow-up>
  Follow-up work:
  - Add unit and integration tests for all authentication flows
  - Document the authentication flow for other developers
  - Create diagrams for token refresh sequence
  - Consider implementing biometric authentication for mobile
  
  Dependencies: None, this component is now complete and ready for testing.
</follow-up>

<aha-moment>
  Realized that we could use a promise-based approach to handle concurrent refresh attempts.
  
  This elegant solution prevents race conditions without adding complex locking mechanisms.
  
  The pattern could be applied to other async operations that need to be synchronized.
</aha-moment>
