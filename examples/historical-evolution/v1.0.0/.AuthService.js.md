  prompt: "Create a simple authentication service for JWT handling"
  requestor: product-manager-456
  requestor-context: "Medium priority, needed for MVP release"
</metadata>

<exploration>
  Explored different authentication approaches:
  1. Session-based authentication with cookies
  2. JWT-based authentication
  3. OAuth integration
  
  Researched JWT libraries and best practices.
  
  Consulted the following resources:
  - JWT.io documentation
  - OWASP security recommendations
  - Team's existing authentication patterns
</exploration>

<trade-off>
  Options considered:
  - Session-based auth: Better for security but requires server-side storage
  - JWT: Stateless and simpler to implement but has token size limitations
  - OAuth: Most comprehensive but overkill for current requirements
  
  Chose JWT because:
  1. Simplicity of implementation for MVP
  2. No need for server-side session storage
  3. Compatibility with planned microservice architecture
</trade-off>

<assumption>
  Critical assumptions made:
  - Backend will provide standard JWT tokens with appropriate expiration
  - All API communication will be over HTTPS
  - User sessions don't need to be invalidated immediately (logout is client-side only)
  
  Validation approach:
  - Manually tested with backend team's test endpoints
  - Verified token structure matches expectations
</assumption>

<technical-debt>
  Shortcuts taken:
  - Storing token in localStorage instead of more secure alternatives
  - No token refresh mechanism implemented
  - No validation of token expiration on client side
  
  Justification:
  - MVP timeline constraints
  - Simplified implementation for initial release
  
  Future improvement plan:
  - Move to HttpOnly cookies or more secure storage
  - Add token refresh logic
  - Implement proper token validation and expiration handling
</technical-debt>

<follow-up>
  Follow-up work needed:
  - Add token refresh mechanism
  - Implement secure token storage
  - Add token validation
  - Create proper error handling with specific error types
  
  Dependencies: Need backend team to implement token refresh endpoint.
