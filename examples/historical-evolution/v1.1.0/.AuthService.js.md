  prompt: "Fix token expiration bug and improve error handling"
  requestor: qa-engineer-234
  requestor-context: "High priority, users are experiencing unexpected logouts"
</metadata>

<bug>
  Users were being kept logged in even after their tokens expired.
  
  Root cause: No client-side validation of token expiration time.
  
  Fix: Added token expiry storage and validation in isAuthenticated() method.
</bug>

<debugging>
  Initially suspected localStorage issues or token format problems.
  
  Logs showed users with expired tokens still passing authentication checks.
  
  Reproduced by manually setting an expired token and observing behavior.
  
  Traced to isAuthenticated() method only checking token existence.
</debugging>

<refactor-reason>
  Refactored error handling in login method.
  
  Improvements after refactoring:
  - More specific error messages from the server are now displayed
  - Better error handling with proper JSON parsing of error responses
  - Clearer separation between authentication logic and token storage
</refactor-reason>

<technical-debt>
  Previous version shortcuts addressed:
  - Added token expiration validation
  - Improved error handling
  
  Remaining shortcuts:
  - Still using localStorage instead of more secure alternatives
  - No token refresh mechanism implemented
  
  Justification for remaining debt:
  - Secure storage requires backend changes that are scheduled for v2.0
  - Token refresh endpoint not yet available from backend
</technical-debt>

<domain-knowledge>
  Applied JWT best practices for token validation.
  Implemented proper expiration time checking.
  [See JWT security guidelines](/knowledge/api/jwt-security-2024-09-30.md)
</domain-knowledge>

<follow-up>
  Follow-up work still needed:
  - Implement secure token storage (move away from localStorage)
  - Add token refresh logic
  - Add proper error types and error handling system
  
  Dependencies: Backend team is implementing token refresh endpoint for next sprint.
