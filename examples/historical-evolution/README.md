# Historical Evolution of Reasoning Traces

This directory demonstrates how reasoning traces evolve over time as code changes and understanding deepens. Each subdirectory represents a version of the same component, showing how the reasoning trace documentation grows and changes alongside the code.

## Structure

- `v1.0.0/` - Initial implementation
- `v1.1.0/` - Bug fix and minor improvements
- `v2.0.0/` - Major refactoring and feature additions

## Purpose

This example illustrates how RTF.md captures the evolution of thought processes, decisions, and context over time, providing a historical record that helps developers understand not just what changed, but why it changed.
