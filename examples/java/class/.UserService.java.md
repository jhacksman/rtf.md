  prompt: "Implement a user service with secure password handling"
  requestor: security-lead-678
  requestor-context: "Critical priority, needed for security compliance audit"
</metadata>

<exploration>
  Explored different approaches for user management in Spring:
  1. Using Spring Data JPA repositories directly in controllers
  2. Creating a service layer with business logic
  3. Using Spring Security's UserDetailsService
  
  Researched password security best practices:
  - Password hashing algorithms (BCrypt, Argon2, PBKDF2)
  - Salt generation and storage
  - Password validation rules
  
  Consulted Spring Security documentation on PasswordEncoder implementations.
</exploration>

<constraint>
  System constraints affecting decisions:
  - Security compliance requirements mandate password encryption
  - User data must be validated before persistence
  - Service must be testable in isolation
  
  Addressed by using dependency injection for repositories and encoders, allowing for mocking in tests and ensuring separation of concerns.
</constraint>

<trade-off>
  Options considered:
  - Handling validation in controller vs. service layer
  - Using annotations vs. programmatic validation
  - Returning domain objects vs. DTOs
  
  Chose service layer validation because:
  1. Centralizes business logic in one place
  2. Allows reuse across different controllers/endpoints
  3. Makes unit testing more straightforward
</trade-off>

<security>
  Security considerations:
  - Password storage using BCrypt hashing
  - No plain text passwords returned in responses
  - Validation to prevent duplicate usernames
  - Exception handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
</security>

<bug>
  Initial implementation allowed password updates without validation.
  
  Root cause: Conditional logic for password updates was missing validation step.
  
  Fix: Added null/empty check and only update password if new value provided.
</bug>

<refactor-reason>
  Refactored from direct field access to using setters.
  
  Improvements after refactoring:
  - Encapsulation of entity state changes
  - Ability to add validation or transformation in setter methods
  - Consistent with JPA entity best practices
</refactor-reason>

<frustration>
  Spring Security configuration was complex and poorly documented.
  
  Overcame by creating a test suite to verify password encoding behavior and consulting with team members who had prior experience.
</frustration>

<follow-up>
  Follow-up work needed:
  - Add role-based access control
  - Implement account locking after failed attempts
  - Add password complexity validation
  - Create audit logging for security events
  
  Dependencies: Need to coordinate with the authentication team on role structure.
