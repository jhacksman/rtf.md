  prompt: "Create a RESTful API for user management"
  requestor: tech-lead-123
  requestor-context: "High priority, needed for frontend team to start integration"
</metadata>

<exploration>
  Explored different API frameworks for Python:
  1. Flask - Lightweight but requires more manual setup
  2. FastAPI - Modern, async-first with automatic OpenAPI docs
  3. Django REST Framework - Full-featured but heavier
  
  Researched best practices for user API endpoints:
  - RESTful naming conventions
  - Proper status codes
  - Input validation approaches
  - Error handling patterns
  
  Consulted FastAPI documentation for Pydantic model integration and dependency injection.
</exploration>

<trade-off>
  Options considered:
  - Comprehensive user model with many fields vs. minimal approach
  - Database ORM integration vs. in-memory for prototype
  - Authentication in same file vs. separate module
  
  Chose FastAPI with minimal user model and in-memory storage because:
  1. Speed of development was critical for this sprint
  2. Automatic OpenAPI documentation helps frontend team
  3. In-memory approach sufficient for prototype, can be replaced later
</trade-off>

<constraint>
  Project constraints affecting decisions:
  - Timeline: API needed within 2 days for frontend team
  - No database setup available yet in the environment
  
  Addressed by using in-memory storage as a temporary solution with models designed to be compatible with future ORM integration.
</constraint>

<technical-debt>
  Shortcuts taken:
  - In-memory database instead of proper persistence
  - No authentication/authorization implementation
  - Basic error handling without custom exception classes
  
  Justification:
  This is a prototype version needed quickly for frontend development.
  
  Future improvement plan:
  - Replace in-memory storage with proper database in next sprint
  - Add authentication middleware
  - Implement comprehensive error handling
</technical-debt>

<edge-case>
  Duplicate username scenario identified during code review.
  
  Added check to prevent duplicate usernames before creating new users.
  
  Implementation validates against existing users in the database before proceeding with creation.
</edge-case>

<pressure>
  Frontend team blocked waiting for this API.
  
  Implemented minimal viable version first, then added validation and error handling.
  
  Prioritized endpoints needed for initial frontend development (create and get).
</pressure>

<follow-up>
  Follow-up work needed:
  - Add update and delete endpoints
  - Implement proper database integration
  - Add authentication and authorization
  - Create comprehensive tests
  
  Dependencies: Database design needs to be finalized before ORM integration.
</follow-up>
